My name is Swarada Bharadwaj and I'm an engineering student at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. My likes include music, coffee, home workouts, reading, hikes, vegetarian food, science and space sci-fi. I try to be a consistent learner and I've loved to write since I was a kid. I'm also interested in a lot of (very different) things. The premise of this blog is simple: it's about everything I've learned recently that I think is worth writing about or sharing. My hope is that writing about ideas will help me remember them, and might also connect me with other people who enjoy them.

I'm going to be regularly updating this blog. If you like anything you've read on here, feel free to reach out to me on socials or send me an email!
