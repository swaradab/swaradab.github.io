My name is Swarada Bharadwaj and I'm a fourth year engineering student at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. My likes include coffee (with milk or no milk), music, home workouts, reading, tea (with milk), hikes, vegetarian food, science and space sci-fi. My dislikes include denim vests and certain movies.

I'm going to be regularly updating this blog. If you like anything you've read on here, feel free to reach out to me on socials or send me an email.
